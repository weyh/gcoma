# gcoma

**gcoma** or **G**eri's **Co**nnection **Ma**nager is a small project, that I started to learn rust.

The goal of this project is to create a MTPuTTY like cli app, where you can easily store/group all your telnet and ssh sessions.

If you find anything that isn't rusty enough feel free to correct me. ðŸ™‚
